## The Problem

Things aren't always received in the order that they're sent.
Even with the guarantee of TCP, the load balancer could lag or a worker could be slow to respond.
The problem gets even worse when expecting responses to return in the same order as the requests are sent.
Recently, we ran into this exact problem where some GraphQL mutation responses would take longer than others.
The root cause was that only some response payloads required a fetch to a third party service, and those would take longer.

## Possible Solutions

Knowing that responses won't return in the same order as their corresponding requests are sent, how could we fix the problem?
On the server, we could implement a lock on that mutation. When a mutation starts, it creates a lock in Redis for that particular user. If it can't achieve the lock, then it waits its turn. This is known as a mutex. While it's a good solution, it has some drawbacks. First, it's a blocking operation, which means that if a mutation takes a long time to complete, then all subsequent mutations will be blocked until the first mutation is completed. Second, it's not very scalable. If we have a lot of users, then we'll have a lot of locks. Third, it's not very resilient. If a worker crashes while processing a mutation, then the lock will be left in Redis, and the next worker will have to wait for the lock to be released. As a general rule of thumb, if we can keep state off the server, we should do that.

In our case, the mutation was idempotent. It simply removed an item from a list by ID and returned the updated list.
If the same mutation got called twice, or if the requests were received out of order, the eventual result would be the same.
Those characteristics meant we could avoid the penalties of a mutex by using casual ordering on the client.

## Client-side Casual Ordering

Setting up casual ordering on the client is essentially a queue.
Before a request is sent to the server, we check for the casual ordering key.
If one doesn't exist, then we know order isn't important.
If one does exist, we assign an incrementing serial ID to the request.
When a response is received, we verify that its request is the lowest value in the queue.
If it is, the request gets processed immediately & the item is removed from the queue.
If it isn't, the payload is cached until the earlier request is processed.

That's it! Of course you can get more sophisticated with timeouts, but the basic idea is the same.
Let's see how it looks in code as a method

```ts
dispatch(message: IncomingMessage) {
  const {id: opId} = message
  const operation = this.operations[opId]
  const {payload} = operation
  const casualOrderingGroup = payload.cacheConfig?.metadata?.casualOrderingGroup ?? null
  if (casualOrderingGroup) {
    const expectedOpIdMismatch = Object.keys(this.operations).find(
      (id) =>
        id < opId &&
        this.operations[id].payload.cacheConfig?.metadata?.casualOrderingGroup ===
          casualOrderingGroup,
    )
    if (expectedOpIdMismatch) {
      // the message dispatched is out of order. queue it until the correct one comes in
      this.pendingMessages.push(message)
      return
    }
  }

  // the message received is the one that should be dispatched, handle the message
  ...

  // attempt to flush the queue
  if (casualOrderingGroup && this.pendingMessages.length > 0) {
    const nextOpIdInGroup = Object.keys(this.operations).find(
      (id) =>
        this.operations[id].payload.cacheConfig?.metadata?.casualOrderingGroup ===
        casualOrderingGroup,
    )
    const pendingMessageIdx = this.pendingMessages.findIndex(
      (pendingMessage) => pendingMessage.id === nextOpIdInGroup,
    )
    if (pendingMessageIdx === -1) return
    const [messageToFlush] = this.pendingMessages.splice(pendingMessageIdx, 1)
    this.dispatch(messageToFlush)
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

I hope this helps you solve race conditions in your GraphQL mutations.
While it's still preferable to write mutations that don't require a strict order, sometimes that isn't possible.
When ordering is required, it's nice to know there's a client-side approach that you can apply without adding complexity to your server.
