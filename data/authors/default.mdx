Matthew Krick is the technical co-founder of Parabol. He grew the company from idea to Series A, backed by investors such as Microsoft, Charles River Ventures, and Slack Fund.

Being the sole engineer for over three years, he has worked across the entire stack, from UX to DevOps.

More recently his focus has been on growing an engineering culture of teamwork and humility, letting the code speaks for itself.

He thrives in delivering a delightful product to users and a simple, understandable, maintainble codebase to developers.
